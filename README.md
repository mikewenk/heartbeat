# heartbeat
This code is a simple flask server to put my heartbeat on my stream.  This is run normally from one of my raspberry pi systems and is hooked up to an Arduino connected to a pulse sensor.  It uses the python serial library to get the data and then flask to return it.  The other end of this is a OBS browser source which displays it on stream.  

This code was written rather quickly...
